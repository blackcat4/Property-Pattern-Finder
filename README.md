# Property-Pattern-Finder
property pattern finder given csv in R
Given a *.csv file name in the current working directory, with column names
of format "p# q#" to stand for property # questions # 
returns all appearing patterns of selected property number across questions,
as well as a histogram of these patterns for visual presentation
of occurences. 

You're welcome to use these files for most any purpose you'd like. 
If you're going to publish anything using them, I'd like to be referenced 
in your published work, and you can reach me at snewt7813@gmail.com 
with questions on how to do so.

If it you have issues with or questions about this program, contact me at above email.
